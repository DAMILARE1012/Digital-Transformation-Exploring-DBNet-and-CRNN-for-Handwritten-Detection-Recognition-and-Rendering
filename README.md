This project, "Digital Transformation: Exploring DBNet and CRNN for Handwritten Detection, Recognition, and Rendering," was carried out in partial fulfillment of my participation in the Computer Vision course.

In this project, we focused on the application of deep learning techniques for the detection and recognition of handwritten text. Specifically, we explored two advanced models: DBNet (Differentiable Binarization Network) for text detection and CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) for text recognition.

Project Highlights:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: We gathered a diverse dataset of handwritten documents. The data underwent preprocessing steps such as normalization, augmentation, and segmentation to enhance the model's performance.
2. DBNet for Text Detection: We implemented DBNet to accurately detect and localize handwritten text regions within the documents. The model was trained and fine-tuned to handle various handwriting styles and document conditions.
3. CRNN for Text Recognition: After detecting text regions, we used CRNN to recognize the handwritten characters. This involved training the CRNN on the segmented text regions to convert the detected handwriting into machine-readable text.
4. Integration and Rendering: The detected and recognized text was then rendered and validated to ensure accuracy. We integrated both models into a cohesive pipeline that could process handwritten documents from detection to recognition and final text rendering.
5. Evaluation and Analysis: The performance of the models was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also conducted a comparative analysis to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented approaches.

This project not only enhanced my understanding of computer vision and deep learning but also provided practical experience in applying these techniques to solve real-world problems. The insights and skills gained through this project are invaluable for my future endeavors in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision.
